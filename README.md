Some scripts:

## Hallucinate
- simply swaps negative and positive prompts for giggles. Best with complicated prompts - but don't blame me for the horror show

## Mr. Negativity
- more advanced script that swaps negative and positive tokens depending on Mr. negativity rage

## Mr. Positivity
- requires both positive and negative prompts. As you move the optimism slider Mr. positivity will start dropping words from the positive prompt and repllacing them with words from the negative prompt.
